## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- 3 phases following pipeline data flow (Foundation -> Research Engine -> Output Pipeline)
- [Roadmap]: CORE-10 (Rich CLI) deferred to Phase 3 since meaningful progress display requires the full pipeline to exist
- [Roadmap]: CORE-08 (token budget) stays in Phase 1 since it is a conductor-level guardrail that research flagged as "non-negotiable from day one"

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Anthropic model IDs for Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6 need exact strings at build time (research gap)
- openevals API (v0.0.11) may change before Phase 3 validation work begins
- Firecrawl v4 SDK method names need verification at Phase 2 implementation time
